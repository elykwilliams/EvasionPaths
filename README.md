# Evasion Paths

This repository implements the algorithm described in _[Evasion paths in mobile sensor networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3536.pdf)_.

See our results _[Efficient Evader Detection in Mobile Sensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09813)_

# Installation
1. Clone this repository. 
From the command line, use the following

```git clone https://www.github.com/elykwilliams/evasion-paths.git```

2. Activate appropriate virtual environment (venv/conda). 
A new environment can be created using

```python3 -m venv venv```

3. Navigate to the source root directory
4. Install using from the command line via pip
