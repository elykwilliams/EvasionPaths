## This class is used to determine and represent the differences between two states.
# This means determining which simplices have been added or removed as well as which
# boundary cycles have been added or removed.
#
# A set of nodes is an added simplex when the nodes
# formed a simplex of the new state but do not form a simplex of the old state Similarly,
# a set of nodes is a removed simplex when the nodes formed a simplex of the old state but
# do not form a simplex of the new state (And similarly for boundary cycles).
#
# This class also has the ability to determine when an atomic state change has occurred.
# A a state change is one of the following
#
#       1. A 1-simplex is added or removed
#       2. A 2-simplex is added or removed
#       3. A free pair consisting of a 2-simplex and a 1-simplex is added
#       4. A delaunay flip occurred
#
# Disconnections and re-connections are simply a special case of removing/adding a 1-Simplex.
#
# The state transitions are identified by simply counting the number of simplices and boundary
# cycles that have been added or removed. With some minimal compatibility checking, this can
# uniquely identify an atomic transition.
