 

# Style
 - Use consistent list/tuple/array 

# Features:
 - add optional setting to enforce connected graph vs power-off

 - integrate support for dynamical systems packages (pydstool, pydy)
 - Add sensor_tools (maybe)
 - support time-series data (pandas)

# Documentation:
 - Migrate to pdoc for documentation
 - Setup documentation git action
 - Document Examples and tutorials
 - src documentation move to google format
 - Add examples of custom_sensor_network
    
# Testing
 - Better error Messages
 - Add logging
 - Add unit tests
 - Setup git action Continuous integration

# Structural:
 - Install using pip/venv 
 - config file: maybe not needed?
 - refactor MotionModel into DataStream 

 # Summer Development:
 - Allow for fully disconnected graph ("power on")
 - AlphaComplex with variable radii
 - Work towards fully distributed algorithm
 - 3D
 
# Future Development
 - Decaying sensing
 - "Smart" Motion Model
 - Measure Complexity and benchmark algorithm
